# NOTE:
# after update, ssh-agent run by x-session-manager is not accessible by keychain (running as me)
# HACK:
# kill running ssh-agent (pid should show up in failed keychain attempt)
# run eval$("ssh-agent") to get agent w/ correct permissions
# run source ~/.bashrc and setup permissions as per usual

hname=$(hostname | sed -e 's/.home//g' | sed -e 's/.local//g')

# base keys
keychain $HOME/.ssh/id_${hname}_${USER}
# project-specific keys here...

source $HOME/.keychain/${hname}-sh
